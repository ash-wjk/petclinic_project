                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                      Pet Care Clinic Animal Clinic is in Croydon, which opened in 2011 by Dr. Gilbertson with a small budget and big heart. Her love for animals made her profession and the clinic first and foremost local veterinary clinics, offering caring and comprehensive treatment for dogs, cats, rabbits, and other domestic pets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our experienced teams of skilled vets and veterinary nurses make it their job to get to know you and your pet. By ensuring we understand your needs, as well as those of your pet, we can discuss and agree the best approach for your pet for anything from routine vaccinations to complex operations and chemotherapy . We will always discuss the treatment plan for your pet with you because we know that no one knows your pet better than you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The clinic is also has state-of-the art hospital facilities. This allows us to provide first class medical, surgical, imaging (X-ray, ultrasound and CT scanning) and 24/7 emergency services to our patients, either directly with our in-house veterinary clinicians or by drawing on the skills and experience of one of the specialist referral clinicians with whom we work collaboratively. Our aim is the advancement of your pet’s health through the practice of informed, caring veterinary medicine.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why are we Different?</h2>
                    <p>
                      Unlike an increasing number of corporate veterinary practices, we continue to offer a personal, caring and realistic approach to veterinary medicine and healthcare. We are very much driven by a desire to deliver the best value healthcare for the pets in our care.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We do not use call centres or separate emergency practices with which you are unfamiliar. Many other practices outsource their emergency service provision meaning that their clients have to travel to strange and unfamiliar practices where fees can be significantly higher - not something we feel our clients would want at a time of high stress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In order for us to continue to improve our service with the rapid advances that are occurring in veterinary medicine, we have to be able to reinvest in our practice to acquire more state of the art equipment, facilities and top-quality staff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At PCC, we simply charge a scale of fees that covers our costs and allows us to reinvest in the practice to continue to provide “Exceptional Care For The Life Of Your Pet”.
                    </p>
